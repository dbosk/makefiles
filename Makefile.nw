\section{Makefile for this framework}\label{Makefile}

The [[Makefile]] for this repository should provide instructions to make all 
the files needed by this framework along with its documentation 
([[makefiles.pdf]]).
<<Makefile>>=
MKFILES+=		  portability.mk subdir.mk
MKFILES+=		  pkg.mk pub.mk transform.mk
MKFILES+=		  tex.mk doc.mk
MKFILES+=		  noweb.mk haskell.mk
MKFILES+=		  exam.mk results.mk

OTHERS+=		  latexmkrc
OTHERS+=		  gitattributes
OTHERS+= 		  Dockerfile

.PHONY: all
all: makefiles.pdf
all: ${MKFILES}
all: ${OTHERS}

<<Makefile target>>
<<Dockerfile target>>
<<makefiles.pdf target>>
<<MKFILES targets>>
<<OTHERS targets>>
@

It also provides targets for creating a Docker image from the [[Dockerfile]] 
and pushing it to Docker Hub.
<<Makefile>>=
DOCKER_ID_USER?=dbosk

.PHONY: docker-makefiles push
docker-makefiles: Dockerfile
	<<Docker image recipe>>

push: docker-makefiles
	<<Docker push recipe>>
@

We also use the package framework ([[pkg.mk]]) to provide a package which can 
install the makefiles on the system.
<<Makefile>>=
<<package setup>>
@

We also need the standard targets for cleaning and some include files.
<<Makefile>>=
.PHONY: clean distclean
clean:
	<<clean recipe>>

distclean:
	<<distclean recipe>>
@

Finally, we need some include files from this very framework.
<<Makefile>>=
INCLUDE_MAKEFILES=.
MAKEFILES_INCLUDE=${INCLUDE_MAKEFILES}
<<include files>>
@

\subsection{This [[Makefile]]'s target}

We also must add a target for this [[Makefile]] itself.
<<Makefile target>>=
Makefile: Makefile.nw
	${NOTANGLE.mk}
@

\subsection{Tangling, weaving and compiling LaTeX}

The documentation depends on the main TeX file, preamble and 
bibliographies.
<<makefiles.pdf target>>=
makefiles.pdf: makefiles.tex preamble.tex makefiles.bib
makefiles.pdf: intro.tex Makefile.tex
makefiles.pdf: exam.bib
makefiles.pdf: transform.bib
makefiles.pdf: tex.bib
makefiles.pdf: Dockerfile.tex
@ We must add the generated files to the clean recipe.
<<clean recipe>>=
${RM} makefiles.pdf
${RM} Dockerfile.tex
@

To automatically compile the documentation, we use the [[tex.mk]] include.
Once this include is present, make will be able to make a [[.pdf]] from a 
[[.tex]] file.
<<include files>>=
include ${MAKEFILES_INCLUDE}/tex.mk
@

Additionally, it depends on [[.tex]] versions of all the [[.mk]] files.
We will generate the targets for both [[.tex]] and [[.mk]] versions, both of 
these are generated from the [[.nw]] file.
The functionality of [[noweb.mk]] allows us to reduce this to the line
equivalent to [[%.mk %.tex: %.nw]] below.
Then the pattern rules will do the work.
<<MKFILES targets>>=
define makefiles_depends
makefiles.pdf: $(1:.mk=.tex)
$(1) $(1:.mk=.tex): $(1).nw
endef

$(foreach mkfile,${MKFILES},$(eval $(call makefiles_depends,${mkfile})))
@

To automatically tangle an [[.nw]] file into an [[.mk]], we use the 
[[noweb.mk]] include.
Once this is present, make knows how to make an [[.mk]] file from an [[.nw]].
<<include files>>=
include ${MAKEFILES_INCLUDE}/noweb.mk
@

We should also add these generated file to the cleaning recipe.
However, we only remove the [[.tex]] files, we keep the tangled [[.mk]] files 
to use the repo as an independent Git submodule in project repos.
<<clean recipe>>=
${RM} ${MKFILES:.mk=.tex}
@

We also have files for which this doesn't work (the target doesn't have the 
name in common with its source).
Then we can provide a one-liner recipe, also thanks to [[noweb.mk]].
<<OTHERS targets>>=
latexmkrc: tex.mk.nw
	${NOTANGLE}

gitattributes: transform.mk.nw
	${NOTANGLE}
@ Of these files, we only want to keep [[latexmkrc]] after cleaning.
<<clean recipe>>=
${RM} gitattributes Dockerfile
@

\subsection{The Docker image}

The [[Dockerfile]] is used to produce a Docker image.
<<Dockerfile target>>=
Dockerfile: Dockerfile.nw
	${NOTANGLE}
@

We provide a phony target [[docker-makefiles]] to produce the [[makefiles]] 
Docker image (see above).
<<Docker image recipe>>=
docker build -t makefiles .
docker tag makefiles ${DOCKER_ID_USER}/makefiles
@

We also provide a phony target [[push]] to push the makefiles image to Docker 
Hub.
<<Docker push recipe>>=
docker push ${DOCKER_ID_USER}/makefiles
@

Lastly, we need to cleaning.
We provide a [[distclean]] target to remove the (quite sizeable) Docker image.
<<distclean recipe>>=
docker image rm makefiles
docker image rm dbosk/makefiles
@

\subsection{Packaging and publication}

We provide a package that installs the makefiles in the system where make can 
find them.
This requires the [[pkg.mk]] include.
<<include files>>=
include ${MAKEFILES_INCLUDE}/pkg.mk
@ We only need to set some variables that [[pkg.mk]] expects.
<<package setup>>=
PKG_PACKAGES?=			    main
PKG_NAME-main= 			    makefiles

PKG_PREFIX=				      /usr/local
PKG_INSTALL_DIR=		    /include

PKG_INSTALL_FILES-main=	${MKFILES}
PKG_TARBALL_FILES-main=	${PKG_INSTALL_FILES-main} ${OTHERS} Makefile README.md

.PHONY: all
all: makefiles.tar.gz
@ Then we want to remove the package when we clean.
<<clean recipe>>=
${RM} makefiles.tar.gz
@
