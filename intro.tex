This chapter will introduce the framwork and introduce it by examples.
In \cref{Makefile}, we examine the \verb'Makefile' for this framwork, \ie to 
build (weave) this documentation and (tangle) all the include files from their 
literate (NOWEB) source files.
This \verb'Makefile' uses a few parts of the framework, but not everything.
In subsequent sections we will cover the remaining parts.
