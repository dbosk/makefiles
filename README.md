makefiles
=========

These are a set of generic makefiles for handling course material and research 
publications in an easy manner.  I started development during my first years as 
Lecturer in Mid Sweden University [MIUN], and they were used there by me and my 
colleagues.  I later added some more research-paper oriented features during my 
doctoral study time in KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden [KTH].
