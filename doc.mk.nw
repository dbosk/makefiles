\section{Introduction and usage}

When working with large sets of documents we sometimes want to do some 
operations on them, e.g.\ print them or convert them between formats.
This include file provides exactly that.

We provide a target [[print]] which prints its prerequisites, see 
\cref{Printing} for details.
We also provide a target [[wc]] which counts the words of its prerequisites 
(\cref{WordCounting}).
Finally, we also provide a set of suffix rules for automatic conversion between 
different formats, see \cref{FormatConversion} for details about the formats.


\section{Implementation}

Since the makefile is designed for inclusion, we want to ensure that it is not 
included more than once --- like we do in C and C++.
Then first comes our variables described above followed by the targets.
<<doc.mk>>=
ifndef DOC_MK
DOC_MK=true

<<variables>>
<<target for printing>>
<<target for word counting>>
<<suffix rules for format conversion>>

endif
@

\subsection{Printing}
\label{Printing}

We provide a target [[print]] to print all documents in a set.
The usage is simply that documents are added as prerequisites, then the target 
prints all documents in its dependency list.
The printing is done using the [[lpr]] command by default.
However, this can be changed with the [[DOC_LPR]] variable.
<<variables>>=
DOC_LPR?=		lpr
@

If [[lpr]] is used, we note that the files added as prerequisites for the 
[[print]] target must be printable by [[lpr]], e.g.\ we must supply 
PostScript-files instead of PDF-files.
Fortunately, the automatic file format conversion (\cref{FormatConversion}) 
solves most of those problems.
For example, if you want to print a PDF-file [[something.pdf]], then just add 
[[something.ps]] as a prerequisite to print and the suffix rules below will do 
the rest.

The implementation is quite simple.
We will iterate through the list of prerequisites and process them one by
one.
The iteration can be done in two ways: do it in the shell or do it using make's 
built-in iteration.
We choose the latter, because that will provide the best output to the user.
<<target for printing>>=
.PHONY: print
print:
	$(foreach doc,$^,${DOC_LPR} ${doc})
@

\subsection{Counting words}
\label{WordCounting}

We provide a [[wc]] target which counts the words in its prerequisites.
The files added as prerequisites must thus be text files.
Similarly as for print, there are suffix rules to convert e.g.\ TeX-files to 
plain text files using [[detex]].

The implementation is similar to that for [[print]].
The counting is done using the [[wc]] command by default, but we allow 
overrides using the following variable.
<<variables>>=
DOC_WC?=    wc -w
@

We will simply iterate through the list of prerequisites and process them one 
by one using [[wc]].
We first print the name followed by a colon, then we print the word count.
<<target for word counting>>=
.PHONY: wc
wc:
	$(foreach doc,$^,echo -n "${doc}: "; ${DOC_WC} ${doc})
@

\subsection{Format conversion}
\label{FormatConversion}

The format conversion is done using suffix rules.
This means that whenever we need a file in a certain format, we simply keep the
name but change the suffix (\enquote{file extension}).
The conversions that are implemented are the following:
<<suffix rules for format conversion>>=
<<PDF to PS>>
<<DVI to PS>>
<<ODT to PDF>>

<<SVG to PDF>>
<<DIA to TeX>>

<<MD to TeX>>
<<TeX to text>>
@

\subsubsection{Document formats}

To convert PDFs to PostScript format, we use the [[pdf2ps]] command by default.
<<variables>>=
PDF2PS?=        pdf2ps
PDFPS?=         ${PDF2PS}
DOC_PDF2PS?=    ${PDFPS}
@ This allows us to specify the rule as follows.
<<PDF to PS>>=
.SUFFIXES: .ps .pdf
.pdf.ps:
	${DOC_PDF2PS} $<
@

We do similarly for DVI-files that we want to convert to PostScript.
<<variables>>=
DVIPS?=         dvips
DOC_DVI2PS?=    ${DVIPS}
@ With those variables we let
<<DVI to PS>>=
.SUFFIXES: .dvi .ps
.dvi.ps:
	${DOC_DVI2PS} $<
@

There is no good conversion program for the Open Document Format (ODF) files.
We will use LibreOffice.
<<variables>>=
DOC_ODT2PDF?=   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf
@ This yields the following suffix rule.
<<ODT to PDF>>=
.SUFFIXES: .odt .pdf
.odt.pdf:
	${DOC_ODT2PDF} $<
@

\subsubsection{Figure formats}

Usually we want to keep figures in their source form, so that we can still edit
them later.
However, just as usually, we cannot use the source form directly in TeX 
documents, so we want to convert them to TeX or PDF.

When working with SVG-files, there are two things: the graphics and the text in 
the graphics.
We will use Inkscape for working with SVGs, because Inkscape allows us to 
export the graphics part as PDF and all text in it as TeX.
Unlike previously, we will only allow flags for [[inkscape]] to be set.
<<variables>>=
DOC_INKSCAPE_FLAGS?=  -D -z --export-latex
@
<<SVG to PDF>>=
.SUFFIXES: .svg .pdf
.svg.pdf:
	inkscape ${DOC_INKSCAPE_FLAGS} --file=$< --export-pdf=$@
@ We can thus create similar rules for the formats PS and EPS, instead of PDF.
<<SVG to PS>>=
.SUFFIXES: .svg .eps .ps
.svg.ps:
	inkscape ${DOC_INKSCAPE_FLAGS} --file=$< --export-ps=$@

.svg.eps:
	inkscape ${DOC_INKSCAPE_FLAGS} --file=$< --export-eps=$@
@

Dia is a useful tool for making figures over network topologies etc.
Fortunately, Dia can output native TeX.
Similarly to Inkscape, we will only provide flags for Dia.
<<variables>>=
DOC_DIA_FLAGS?=
@ That gives the suffix rule as follows.
<<DIA to TeX>>=
.SUFFIXES: .dia .tex
.dia.tex:
	dia ${DOC_DIA_FLAGS} -e $@ -t pgf-tex $<
@

\subsubsection{Text-based formats}

The conversion of the text-based formats differ from the formats above.
Most of these tools automatically write their output to stdout, which is 
customary when working with text in the terminal.

We use the [[pandoc]] program to convert between Markdown and TeX.
<<variables>>=
DOC_MD2TEX?=    pandoc -f markdown -t latex
@ This gives the following suffix rule.
<<MD to TeX>>=
.SUFFIXES: .md .tex
.md.tex:
	${DOC_MD2TEX} < $< > $@
@

There are times when we want to convert out TeX-files to plain text, e.g.\ to 
count the words.
To do this we simply use the [[detex]] program.
<<variables>>=
DOC_TEX2TEXT?=  detex
@ This gives us the following suffix rule.
<<TeX to text>>=
.SUFFIXES: .tex .txt
.tex.txt:
	${DOC_TEX2TEXT} $< > $@
@
